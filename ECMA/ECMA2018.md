1. [Finally](../examples/ECMA2018/finally.js)

```promise.finally(func) is similar to promise.then(func, func), but is different in a few critical ways:


When creating a function inline, you can pass it once, instead of being forced to either declare it twice, or create a variable for it

A finally callback will not receive any argument, since there's no reliable means of determining if the promise was fulfilled or rejected. 

This use case is for precisely when you do not care about the rejection reason, or the fulfillment value, and so there's no need to provide it.

Unlike,
  Promise.resolve(2).then(() => {}, () => {}) (which will be resolved with undefined), 
  
  Promise.resolve(2).finally(() => {}) will be resolved with 2.
  
Similarly, unlike 
  Promise.reject(3).then(() => {}, () => {}) (which will be resolved with undefined), Promise.reject(3).finally(() => {}) will be rejected with 3.
```
